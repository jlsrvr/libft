# libft
This is the first project that I had to do when arriving at Ecole 42 in Paris.

## Aim
We were asked to recode, from scratch, some of the basic functions of the c libraries plus any we thought usefull.
During this project I got to grips with applying the TDD principals I had learnt in ruby to C.
You will can my test suite [here](https://github.com/jlsrvr/libft-specs).

##Usage
Since then I have been adding any function that I need on a regular basis. I also use this library in most my following projects.
